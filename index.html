        <p>Hey Yashu,<br>
          <br>
        Can you believe how much we've packed into such a short time? It feels like we've known each other forever!<br>
        <br>
        I've always admired your contagious positivity and how you approach everything with a smile. Whether we're having a deep conversation, sharing jokes, or even teasing you a bit (you know we do it out of love!), your ability to handle everything with grace and brighten everyone's day is truly remarkable.<br>
        <br>
        On your special day, I want to celebrate not just the amazing friend you are but the incredible person who brings joy to everyone around you.<br>
        <br>
        Happy Birthday! Here's to many more years of laughter, inside jokes, and unforgettable memories together.<br>
          <br>
        Sending you lots of love and warm wishes,<br>
